# Year-Book
Yearbook Site created for getting details during Final Year. Back-end was created by me. I used a template from tympanus.net for the front-end and modified it heavily. 

It also gets photos from the user and saves it to the server securely so that it is inaccessible other than the person who uploaded it. Photos are converted to thumbnail pics and when next time user logins thumbnails are loaded, so as to save bandwidth and provide quicker page load.
